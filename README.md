# how can i use it?
this script change your mac address and ip address using the network protocol DHCP, without down your internet, you can automatize it in crontabs, using crontab -e to add a new script, is very util to avoid attacks from a remote computer that can steal your ip address and mac address.
use it to avoid packet injections and DOS attacks.
donÂ´t use static ip anymore!
